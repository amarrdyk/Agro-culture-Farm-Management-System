# Agro-culture-Farm-Management-System

In this Project Our Client, who is an agriculturist wanted us to build a solution that can help to sell every Crop-related operation. Keeping the client's requirements in mind, we developed a Crop Selling Software System well equipped with features for Selling Crops. One business model that is evolving is sometimes referred to as the "choiceboard." This is where the consumer, through the Internet, clicks on the features and prices of what he or she wishes to purchase. The farmer provides an online configurator that allows the consumer to select what options he or she is willing to buy and at what price.

> The main objective of this project is to provide a platform to farmers to sell their crop yield.
> This platform enables economic upliftment of the farmers.
> It accommodates direct transaction between buyers and sellers.
> The motive of the project is to create the digital agriculture transaction.
